# ${1:Descriptive Statistics & Plotting Likert Scales}

## This script contains code to produce szmmaries and plots of one-sample Likert data. 
## http://rcompanion.org/handbook/E_03.html

# Installation

## I used the free statistical software programme R (https://www.r-project.org/) to write and analyse my data. Once R is up and running, install and load the following CRAN packages:

## - psych
## - likert

# Usage

## Feel free to use whatever code you like. All I kindly ask in return is that you cite it appropriately :)
